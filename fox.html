        <p class="animal_bio">Foxes are members of the Canidae family.
            Across various cultures, foxes are often portrayed as 
            symbols of trickery and intelligence, usually being the clever
            protangonist or scheming villain of folktales. In Japanese folklore, foxes yokai, or kitsune, are depicted 
            as mystical creatures capable of shape-shifting and possessing magical 
            abilities. Foxes are found in various colors, such as orange, brown
            and white, as adaptations to their environment.
