        <!-- Animal Bio -->
        <p class="animal_bio">Hamsters, members of the rodent family Cricetidae, are common
            housepets in America, usually given to children. They are characterized
            by their short legs, round bodies and dense fur. In folklore, Hamsters
            are generally associated with hard work and industriousness. In media, they are 
            depicted as using charm and determination to overcome their small size.
