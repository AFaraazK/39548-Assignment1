        <p class="animal_bio">Ravens are highly intelligent birds of the family Corvids. They are know for
            their black feathers and distinctive calls. In many mythologies and folklores,
            they are associated with bad omens and death. In Greek mythology,
            Ravens are the messengers of prophecy, and in Norse, they are associated
            with Odin, the All Father. Ravens have very sophistacted social structures
            and are able to learn and adapt.
